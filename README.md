# C# BSP tree implementation
Note that this project does not contain any significant or emerging BSP tree implementation.

This only need for understanding the full dataflow from creating BSP trees from the set of planes to representing it and performing boolean operations and transformations.

This project includes methods of BSP tree constructing from the set of points, describing polyhedrons and methods for transforming single BSP and merging multiple BSPs.
